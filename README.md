# typical-todo-List---JavaScript
My first ToDo list 
This is a simple ToDo List WebApp.
You can change or remove the logo in the style.css area.
Its very hackable to make large or small, just own it!
I would like to make is a phone app and use iphone memory in stead of my hosting server.
I love that it works and not like most downloads like React and old versions.
Good luck have fun,.
